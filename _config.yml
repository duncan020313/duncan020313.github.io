  Researcher Dongjae Leeâ€™s Blog
  I specialize in software engineering automation driven by large language models (LLMs) and intelligent agents,
  with a research focus at the intersection of programming languages and modern machine learning.
  My goal is to design robust and trustworthy AI-based programming systems by integrating advanced static analysis methodologies
  and formal verification techniques, ensuring both safety and reliability in AI-driven software development.
